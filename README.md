Writing texts might seem like a walk in the park until you're caught up in a labyrinth of your own thoughts. You start with a brilliant idea, dancing in your mind, and you know exactly how you want to present it. But, when you sit down to write, it's like trying to catch a butterfly with chopsticks. Hours tick by, filled with procrastination and a relentless pursuit of the perfect sentence. After days of struggle, you finally pin down those elusive words, only to find that your text is missing some essential pieces. So, why not skip the chase and head straight to the catch?
